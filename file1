this is just to see what happens with git.

guess im getting the hang of it all. goodie goodie!

what happens after modifying?
--you will have to use git add again to overwrite existing file.
--git commit? i have no idea (yet) what this does exactly.
--git push to have the local file show up on git hub.

what happens after modifying online?
--no need for git status (it seems this looks at the status of the local
  repository alone.
--git pull to 'pull' the changes made online.

at what point does git merge work?
